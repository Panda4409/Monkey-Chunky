# Monkey Chunky App

Hi, my name is Nishka and I am 12 years old. I know how to read fluently, but when I was little it got difficult. So the Monkey Chunky app will help younger ones read more easily, and they can practice reading while having fun. The user can enter any word and the app will break it down into phonic chunks. User can tap on the phonic chunks to hear the corresponding sound of the phones that make the word. Hope you enjoy!
